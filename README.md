# Sword-Basic-IO
Created for Vivado 2016.4

This project demonstrates the use of the VGA Port, Keypad, USB-UART, Seven Segment Display, RGB and regular LEDs, and the Switches on the Sword board with a Microblaze processor.

This demo can be programmed onto a Sword board by following the [Using Digilent Github Demo Projects](https://reference.digilentinc.com/learn/programmable-logic/tutorials/github-demos/start) tutorial.

While following the tutorial above, keep in mind that this demo is an HDL-only project, and does not use Vivado SDK.
